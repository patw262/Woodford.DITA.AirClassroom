   <title>Computers</title>
   <p>Shanks Hall rooms 360 and 180 are equipped with iMac desktop computers, ideal for academic
        use. These computers are pre-loaded with software ranging from Adobe Creative Cloud and MS
        Office, to GarageBand. Feel free to load your own programs and files onto the computers, but
        unless you save on a personal hard drive your files will be erased when the computer shuts
        down.</p>
